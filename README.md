This repository contains all the investigation results for determing the  effectiveness of MC/DC testing vis-Ã -vis
white-box pairwise, 3-way and 4-way testing.

For pairwise, 3-way and 4-way testing, we have used PICT (Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing tool) tool.

PICT generates test cases and test configurations.
PICT tool can be download from here: https://github.com/microsoft/pict
